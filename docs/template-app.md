### Template App
1. Clone willcapo-angular-6 locally, i.e. make a copy of it.
2. Ignore the .git when copying, or, rm .git once you copy
3. Make it black-and-white, strip out willcapo references. 
4. Now init git, this way there's no history traced to the old willcapo content.
5. Create github.com/thinkocapo/template-app
6. Connect local app to origin /template-app
